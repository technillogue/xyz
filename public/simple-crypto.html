people want to do stuff together—even with people they don't trust!—like agree about who sent what $$$<br/>
to do this, you need to allow anyone who joins to agree on and add to a table of what $$$-sending happened.<br/>
people might want to add to the table that someone sent them $$$ even when they didn't<br/>
so,,,,, you have a hard number question you ask people to do.<br/>
you make it SO HARD that no matter how fast people might try, it always takes about ten minutes (if not, make it MORE HARDEST)<br/>
people pay $$$ by shouting: funny letters that prove who they are + how much $$$ + to whom. they get to just shout whatever, too<br/>
they also can make funny short letters that prove you saw a lot of words and promising some $$$ to whom ever first writes them down<br/>
new block table is: funny short letters proving which certain words you saw in the last block + pay events + answer hard number problem<br/>
first person to answer hard number problem gets promised money and some free money, usually little money<br/>
you can try answer number problem on your own, and lie. but the father back you try to change the past, the more hard number problem<br/>
everyone ends up paying for more computer to answer number problem to get more money. you would have to get more computer to change old blocks<br/>
!!!news flash!!!: they made new funny letters. now you can promise money for computers to do exactly what you say.<br/>
now the computers can come money around how you said, and everyone can prove they did exactly what you had said.<br/>
this lets people do more stuff with people they trust even less. people start doing a whole lot of strange stuff.<br/>
now people can agree to pay money one way if something happens, and another way if it doesn't. even without asking the state!<br/>
now you can have $$$ just be like like a sticker: "who gets to say they own this thing". people can send the sticker for money.<br/>
there's only one of each sticker. they look different, you can't make one sticker into another<br/>
you can even make the computers give you some of the money people will get to sell their sticker<br/>
(remember, you don't have to have a bank or other person you need to trust to do this)<br/>
!!!news flash!!!: everyone wants this $$$ so they made more computers; oh no... so many computer make our big rock ball more hot.<br/>
what if the hard question was still hard but didn't make computer hot? what if... when people lie, they have less money?<br/>
fuck, what if someone just shows up and buys all of this kind of money?<br/>
maybe the hard question just makes you remember so many words that it is hard.  does that work? i don't know<br/>
!!!news flash!!!<br/>
this one guy made up new funny letters. now people can talk without anyone being able to hear—but time it's good<br/>
he  also on a cool boat once and some other interesting shit, so we thought he was cool. everyone likes his way of computer<br/>
but wait, he made a new kind of $$$. it makes people have less money if they lie when they make new blocks. to do that...<br/>
you need to there to be people who would not want to have less money by lying. so you make a lot of money and give it to people for $0.80<br/>
and then you stick it in the place where everyone talks without others hearing.<br/>
now everyone wants that $$$! now people will pay $53 for it?! others are mad<br/>
it doesn't let people make computers say strange stuff, but it's very fast and doesn't make computer hot. maybe it's not safe? don't know<br/>
